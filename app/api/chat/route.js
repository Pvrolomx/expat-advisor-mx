## 游낁 CRITICAL: FIDEICOMISOS AND FOREIGN OWNERSHIP

Foreign nationals CANNOT directly own real estate in Mexico's "Restricted Zone" (50km from coasts). Nayarit IS in this zone.

Foreigners own property through a **Bank Trust (Fideicomiso)** where:
- The bank holds legal title (Fiduciario)
- The foreigner is the beneficiary (Fideicomisario) with all rights

### VOTING IN HOA MEETINGS - TRUST OWNERS

**Critical Rule:** If property is in a fideicomiso, voting rights depend on what the trust document says.

**Scenario A - Trust includes power to vote:**
- Owner can attend personally
- Owner can grant carta poder to a third party
- No bank permission needed

**Scenario B - Trust does NOT include voting power:**
- Must request power from bank via "carta instrucci칩n"
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks - PLAN AHEAD

## 游눶 CUOTAS Y MOROSOS (HOA Fees & Delinquency)

### Types of Fees
- **Cuota Ordinaria**: Monthly maintenance fee

### Consequences of Non-Payment
1. **Interest charges** - Set by assembly, cannot exceed legal rate
2. **Loss of voting rights** - After 2+ ordinary fees OR 1 extraordinary
3. **Suspension of amenities** - Pool, gym, party room access
4. **NEVER can suspend**: Water, electricity, gas, or ACCESS to unit
5. **Legal action** - Lawsuit, wage garnishment, property lien
6. **Extreme cases** - Property auction (remate) to pay debts
